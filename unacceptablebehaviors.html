## Unacceptable Behaviors and Cluster Usage Policies

Understanding what constitutes misuse of cluster resources is crucial for maintaining a productive and secure research computing environment. The following behaviors are generally considered unacceptable and may result in account suspension or termination:

<h3>  1. Resource Abuse </h3>

- **Hogging Resources**: Submitting an excessive number of jobs or requesting more resources than necessary, preventing other users from accessing the cluster.
- **Ignoring Queue Policies**: Consistently submitting jobs to inappropriate queues or violating queue-specific limits.
- **Circumventing Fairshare Mechanisms**: Attempting to game the system to get more than your fair share of resources.

<h3>  2. Security Violations </h3>

- **Unauthorized Access**: Attempting to access other users' data or trying to elevate your privileges on the system.
- **Sharing Credentials**: Giving your login information to others or allowing unauthorized users to access the cluster through your account.
- **Installing Malicious Software**: Introducing malware, viruses, or any unauthorized software to the cluster.

<h3>  3. Inappropriate Use of Compute Resources </h3>

- **Non-Research Activities**: Using the cluster for non-academic or non-approved purposes.

<h3>  4. Misuse of Data and Storage </h3>

- **Storing Inappropriate Content**: Using cluster storage for personal files, especially large media files or inappropriate content.
- **Data Theft**: Attempting to exfiltrate large amounts of data or sensitive information from the cluster.
- **Excessive I/O Operations**: Running jobs that perform excessive read/write operations, potentially damaging the storage systems.

<h3>  5. Violation of Software Licenses </h3>

- **License Violations**: Using software in violation of its license terms or using more licenses than allocated to you.

<h3>  6. Disrupting Cluster Operations </h3>

- **Denial of Service**: Intentionally or unintentionally running jobs that crash nodes or disrupt cluster services.

<h3>  7. Non-Compliance with Policies </h3>

- **Ignoring System Announcements**: Consistently disregarding important announcements from system administrators.

<h3>  8. Attempts to Evade Monitoring or Quotas </h3>

- **Hiding Activities**: Attempting to conceal the nature of your computations or evade system monitoring tools.
- **Quota Evasion**: Trying to bypass storage quotas or other resource limitations set by administrators.

<h3>  Consequences of Violations </h3>

The consequences of engaging in these behaviors can include:

1. Temporary suspension of your account
2. Permanent revocation of cluster access
3. Reporting to your supervisor, department, or funding agency

<h3>  Best Practices to Avoid Violations </h3>

1. **Read and Understand Policies**: Familiarize yourself with all cluster usage policies and guidelines.
2. **When in Doubt, Ask**: If you're unsure about whether a particular use is acceptable, consult with cluster administrators.
3. **Regular Check-ins**: Periodically review your resource usage and job patterns to ensure compliance.
4. **Report Suspicious Activities**: If you notice potential misuse by others, report it to the administrators.
5. **Respect Others**: Remember that the cluster is a shared resource. Be considerate of other users' needs.

By adhering to these guidelines and using the cluster responsibly, you help maintain a productive and secure research computing environment for everyone.
