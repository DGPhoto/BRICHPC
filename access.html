    <h2> Getting Access</h2>

    Of course the first step for using the cluster is having access to it.
    For that you must be sure to have:

    <ol>
<li>Your KU credentials: user and password.</li>
<li>Permissions on the cluster, both for the servers and the project folders. You have to ask to your Group Leader for these, he/she being the only one who knows who you are and where you do belong.</li>
<li>Access to KU network.</li>
<li>Access to a terminal/terminal emulator.</li>

    </ol>

<h3>Your KU credentials</h3>
You need an alfanumeric user abx123 with the relative password. These are granted by KU-IT, contact your HR department if you don't have them.

<h3>Permissions</h3>
When you are in possession of KU credentials, you have to ask your Group Leader/Responsible to grant you permission on both the cluster and the shared folder where the data is stored.
In case of the  an Example group:
<br>
<li>SRV-examplehead-users: the head node</li>
<li>SRV-examplegpun-users: the computing node </li>
<li>/project/example_lab_shared/SHARES: group shares </li>

Your Group Leader/Responsible is the only person who knows who you are and which roles you should have access to. <br>

<h3>Access to KU Network</h3>

In order to access the cluster you have to be in the KU network either physically or virtually, as for security reasons is not possibe to access the servers from outside.
In case you need to work from remote, you can use KU VPN downloading and installing  the VPN client from  <a href="vpn.ku.dk"> this </a> website.


<h3>Terminal</h3>

To access the cluster you need a terminal or a terminal emulator. On Linux and Apple systems you can just open a console, in Windows you can use the PowerShell.
Once you fired up your terminal you need to use the SSH (secure shell) command to connect:

<pre class="command-line">ssh kuser@examplehead01fl</pre>

where kuser is  your alphanumerical KU user id and examplehead01fl is the head node of the cluster (headnode name + 01fl suffix).
