<ul>
<li><strong>Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty</strong>: Using the cluster to engage in academic misconduct.</li>
<li><strong>Violating Research Ethics</strong>: Using the cluster for research activities that violate ethical guidelines or have not received proper approvals (e.g., IRB approval for human subjects research).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-non-compliance-with-policies">8. Non-Compliance with Policies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring System Announcements</strong>: Consistently disregarding important announcements from system administrators.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="consequences-of-violations">Consequences of Violations</h3>
<p>The consequences of engaging in these behaviors can include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporary suspension of your account</li>
<li>Permanent revocation of cluster access</li>
<li>Reporting to your supervisor, department, or funding agency</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="best-practices-to-avoid-violations">Best Practices to Avoid Violations</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read and Understand Policies</strong>: Familiarize yourself with all cluster usage policies and guidelines.</li>
